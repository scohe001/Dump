 - Fix howgood replies bug (see closet message :52346396)
 - Modify custom reports to wrap custom message in quotes and add "by [User]" (see example closet message :52350437)
 - Turn down chatty odds
 - On feedback given (tp/fp/rude)...
   - Check if user has given feedback already...
     - If they've given the feedback they're trying to give, remove (ie: responding "tp" twice would first set tp and then remove it)
     - If they've given a feedback and they're giving a new one, clear the first feedback and set the second (with a custom message)
   - Check total number of feedback records attributed to user...
     - Print congratulatory message if they've reached a milestone
       - ie: "Congratulations on your first feedback, @User! Now feed me moooaaaare :D"
       - ie: "Let's all give @User a pat on the back for their 25th feedback!"
       - ie: "Wowza!! That was your 100th feedback, @User! You're kicking butt!!"
       - ie: "Holy moly did you really just give me your 250th feedback, @User?!"
- Create a scoreboard mention command (ie: "@ips, gimme the scoreboard")
  - Show the top 10 users with most feedbacks in a table of "User | XXX Total | YYY tp's | ZZZ fp's"
